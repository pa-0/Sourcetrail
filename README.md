# How to Build

Building Sourcetrail requires several dependencies to be in place on your machine. However, our CMake based setup allows to disable indexing support for specific languages which reduces the number of dependencies to a minimum.

## Building the Base Application

### Required Tools

* __CMake v3.20 (required for Windows, Linux and MacOS)__
    * __Reason__: Used to generate a build configuration for your build system
    * __Download__: https://cmake.org/download

* __Git (required for Windows, Linux and MacOS)__
    * __Reason__: Used for version control and to automatically generate the Sourcetrail version number from commits and tags
    * __Download__: https://git-scm.com/download
    * __Remarks__: Make sure `git` is added to your `PATH` environment variable before running CMake

* __Visual Studio (required for Windows)__
    * __Reason__: Used for building Sourcetrail
    * __Download__: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

* __ccache (optional for Linux and MacOS)__
    * __Reason__: Used to speed up rebuilds if found in `PATH`
    * __Download__: https://ccache.dev/download.html

### Required dependencies

* __Boost 1.74__
    * __Reason__: Used for file system access and interprocess communication
    * __Prebuilt Download for Windows__: https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/
    * __Building for Unix__:
        ```
        $ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=filesystem,program_options,system,date_time
        $ ./b2 --link=static --variant=release --threading=multi --runtime-link=static --cxxflags=-fPIC
        ```

* __Qt 5.15__
    * __Reason__: Used for rendering the GUI and for starting additional (indexer) processes.
    * __Prebuilt Download__: http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/

### Building

#### On Windows `Faced some problems with Conan2 and Windows`
* To set up your build environment run:
    ```
    $ pip install conan
    $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OpenSourceSourceTrail/Sourcetrail.git
    $ cd Sourcetrail
    $ conan install . -s build_type=Release -of .conan/vc/ -b missing
    $ cmake --preset=vc_release
    $ cd ../build/Release/
    $ ninja
    ```

#### On Unix

* To set up your build environment run:
    ```
    $ pip install conan
    $ git clone  --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OpenSourceSourceTrail/Sourcetrail.git
    $ cd Sourcetrail
    $ conan install . -s build_type=Release -of .conan/gcc/ -b missing -pr:a .conan/gcc/profile
    $ cmake --preset=gnu_release
    $ cd ../build/Release/GNU
    $ ninja
    ```

### Running

* Run Sourcetrail from within the build directory. During execution Sourcetrail needs resources from `bin/app/data` and `bin/app/user`. CMake creates symlinks within the build directory that make these directories accessible.

## Enable C/C++ Language Support

### Required dependencies

* __LLVM/Clang 15.0.7__
    * __Reason__: Used for running the preprocessor on the indexed source code, building and traversing an Abstract Syntax Tree and generating error messages.
    * __Building__: Make sure to check out the correct tag: `git checkout llvmorg-15.0.7`
    * __Building for Windows__: Follow [these steps](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) to build the project. Run the cmake command exactly as described. Make sure to build with `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS:STRING=clang -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI:BOOL=ON -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host`.
    * __Building for Unix__: Follow this [installation guide](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.html) to build the project. Make sure to build with `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS:STRING=clang -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI:BOOL=ON -DCLANG_LINK_CLANG_DYLIB:BOOL=ON -DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB:BOOL=ON -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host`.

### Building

* Run CMake with these additional options:
    ```
    -DClang_DIR=<path/to/llvm_build>/lib/cmake/clang
    -DBUILD_CXX_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE=ON
    ```
* Build Sourcetrail as described [above](#building).
